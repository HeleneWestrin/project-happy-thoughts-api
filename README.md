# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project was to create an API using Express.js and connect it to a MongoDB databasw for a previous project called Happy Thoughts.

## The problem

It was fairly straight forward. I did update it so that a user can remove a like now as well, and also used PUT instead of POST for the likes. I ran into some syntax errors that I needed to fix, but all in all it was a smooth project.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
