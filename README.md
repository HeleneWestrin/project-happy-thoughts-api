# Project Happy Thoughts API

The project was to create an API using Express.js and connect it to a MongoDB database for a previous project called Happy Thoughts.

## The problem

It was fairly straight forward. I did update it so that a user can remove a like now as well, and also used PUT instead of POST for the likes. I ran into some small errors that I needed to fix, but all in all it was a smooth project.
